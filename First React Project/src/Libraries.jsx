        </ul>
        <h2>React Router</h2>
        <p>
            React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering--so take your pick!
        </p>
        <h2>Redux</h2>
        <p>
            Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.
        </p>
        <h2>React Bootstrap</h2>
        <p>
            React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.
        </p>
        <h2>React Material UI</h2>
        <p>
            Material-UI is a simple and customizable component library to build faster, beautiful, and more accessible React applications. Follow your own design system, or start with Material Design.
        </p>
        <h2>React Native</h2>
        <p>
            React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces. With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform.
